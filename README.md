## 📝 Task 6: SQL Queries on Online Sales Data  

In this task, I worked on analyzing the **online sales dataset** using SQL.  

- Extracted the month from the order date to study sales trends.  
- Grouped the data by year and month to calculate total orders and total revenue.  
- Calculated the overall revenue using the SUM function.  
- Identified unique transactions by counting distinct Transaction IDs.  
- Filtered and limited the results to show sales specifically for the year 2024.  

✅ This task helped me practice working with **date functions, aggregate functions, grouping, filtering, and distinct values** in SQL.
